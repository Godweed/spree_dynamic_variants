SpreeDynamicVariants
====================

This Gems creates variants for a Spree/Solidus Shop when needed.
Useful for products with many options.
Dynamic Variant Creation is a better alternative than creating multimillion variant entries for each possible option combination.

Assumes the Variant will be combined and sent after ordering.
Therefore:
If track inventory is on, the newly created variant will have track_inventory = false.

Show all available options as dropdowns in product screen.
When product is put in cart, the correct variant is created if it doesn't exist yet.
Also works for Backend Order Creation.
